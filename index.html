        <h1>cave: Roommate Bill Management App</h1>
        <p>An all-in-one solution for college students to manage shared expenses</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="process-section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        
        <div class="problem-statement">
          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>"College students renting with multiple roommates want a simple way to handle the bill-splitting-and-paying process for house/apartment related costs."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Situation</h3>
        <p>This project was developed as part of my UX/UI design course at the University of Michigan. Our assignment was to identify a common challenge faced by students on campus and create a digital solution to address it. Through preliminary conversations with fellow students, I discovered that managing shared expenses among roommates was a significant pain point for many.</p>
        
        <p>Students living off-campus with multiple roommates frequently expressed frustration about the complexity of tracking different types of payments, deciding how to split costs fairly, and ensuring everyone paid on time. Many were using a combination of text messages, Venmo requests, and spreadsheets to manage these expenses, leading to confusion, arguments, and occasionally missed payments.</p>
        
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>I conducted interviews with several University of Michigan students to understand their challenges with roommate expense management. One particularly insightful interview revealed recurring conflicts over grocery shopping:</p>
        
        <div class="user-quote">
          "We share groceries but I'd never get them myself. I feel bad about voicing my opinion about what I want. We argue about groceries often... We buy in bulk, like potatoes, and split them so we can eat fresh, then pay 1/3 each. But it's too much work tracking who eats what." - Xinying, Junior, Computer Science
        </div>
        
        <p>Based on my research, I identified several key insights:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Students struggle with tracking multiple payment types (rent, utilities, WiFi, groceries)</li>
          <li>Equal splitting isn't always fair when usage or preferences differ</li>
          <li>Existing solutions require too much manual tracking and coordination</li>
          <li>Students want an automated system that minimizes the need for confrontation</li>
          <li>Many don't know if suitable apps exist or find current options too complicated</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="process-grid">
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/xchew.png" alt="User Interview Notes">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>From these insights, I defined the following objectives for cave:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Create an all-in-one platform for handling all shared household expenses</li>
          <li>Enable customizable splitting ratios for different expense types</li>
          <li>Streamline the payment process to minimize friction</li>
          <li>Reduce potential for conflicts through transparent tracking</li>
          <li>Make the app intuitive enough that no specialized knowledge is required</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Action</h3>
        <p>I began the design process by creating low-fidelity sketches focusing on three core features:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Cave System:</strong> A fun and intuitive way to group roommates who share expenses</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Payment Options:</strong> Integration with various digital payment systems</li>
          <li><strong>Customizable Splitting:</strong> Adjustable percentages for fair expense division</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="process-grid">
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p1payment.png" alt="Initial Sketches ">
          </div>
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p1cave.png" alt="Low-fidelity Wireframes">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>After creating initial wireframes, I conducted usability testing with five students to refine the user flow. This revealed several important insights:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Users wanted to see payment history at a glance</li>
          <li>The "Cave" metaphor was confusing - "Household" was clearer</li>
          <li>Users needed a way to handle one-time expenses alongside recurring bills</li>
          <li>Notifications for upcoming and past-due payments were highly desired</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Based on this feedback, I iterated on the design to include:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>A dashboard showing upcoming payments and household balance</li>
          <li>Simplified household creation and member invitation process</li>
          <li>Custom categories for different expense types (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)</li>
          <li>Various splitting methods (equal, percentage-based, itemized)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="process-grid">
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p1home.png" alt="Mid-fidelity Wireframes">
          </div>
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p1add.png" alt="High-fidelity Prototype">
          </div>
          
        </div>
        
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>The final cave design delivers a clean, intuitive interface that addresses the core problems identified in research. The app includes:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Household management for grouping roommates who share expenses</li>
          <li>Bill categorization and tracking for different expense types</li>
          <li>Multiple splitting options with customizable percentages</li>
          <li>Integration with popular payment platforms</li>
          <li>Automated recurring payments for regular bills</li>
          <li>Transparent history and notification system</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>User testing of the high-fidelity prototype showed significant enthusiasm for the product, with all test participants expressing they would use the app if available. The ability to handle groceries alongside utilities and rent was particularly well-received.</p>

        <p>For future development, I plan to build out a functional mobile app using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. This would require me to either learn mobile development or partner with a developer to bring the product to market.</p>
        
        <p>This project taught me valuable lessons about the importance of understanding specific user contexts and pain points. What seemed initially like a simple problem (splitting bills) revealed layers of social and practical complexity. It reinforced my belief that good design solutions come from deep user research and iterative testing rather than assumptions.</p>

They often rely on third-party reviews rather than asking waitstaff for recommendations, yet the process of researching dishes while dining can be cumbersome and time-consuming.</p>
        
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>My research began with conducting user interviews to understand how different people approach ordering food at restaurants. I interviewed three junior-level computer science and engineering students with varying personality types to identify patterns in their decision-making processes.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Key insights from the interviews revealed:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Introverted users often avoid asking waitstaff for recommendations due to shyness</li>
          <li>Tech-savvy users prefer online reviews over in-person recommendations</li>
          <li>Decision-making time varies significantly based on personality type</li>
          <li>Price and taste were primary considerations when choosing menu items</li>
          <li>Most users preferred to research options before arriving at the restaurant</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Based on these findings, I developed the following objectives for the app:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Create a one-stop solution for getting fact-based menu recommendations</li>
          <li>Reduce the time spent researching food options online</li>
          <li>Provide an alternative to asking waitstaff for recommendations</li>
          <li>Allow users to set preferences for personalized suggestions</li>
          <li>Enable both in-restaurant use (menu scanning) and pre-visit planning</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="user-quote">
          "I usually go to a restaurant because I know a popular food, or a general idea of a good choice. Or I look at the ingredients below the food, then get the ingredients that I usually go for. Or I ask somebody." - Rinny, Computer Science Junior

        <h3>Action</h3>
        <p>With a clear understanding of user needs, I began the design process by identifying the core features needed in the app. I created sketches and low-fidelity wireframes focusing on four main functionalities:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Scanner:</strong> A feature allowing users to take photos of physical menus for instant analysis</li>
          <li><strong>Map:</strong> Location-based food finding for planning before arrival</li>
          <li><strong>History:</strong> Record keeping of previously ordered and reviewed dishes</li>
          <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Customization options for dietary preferences and other filters</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="process-grid">
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p2cam.png" alt="Initial Sketches and Wireframes">
          </div>
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p2done.png" alt="Mid-fidelity Wireframes">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>After creating initial wireframes, I conducted usability testing to refine the user flow. This revealed several unexpected insights:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Some extroverted users actually enjoy the process of asking for recommendations</li>
          <li>Many users wanted to use the app before arriving at the restaurant to plan ahead</li>
          <li>Users expected clear information about the generation process in real-time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Based on this feedback, I iterated on the design to include:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>A generation progress indicator showing real-time status</li>
          <li>Responsive buttons that change opacity based on availability of actions</li>
          <li>A "modify preferences" button directly on the results page</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="process-grid">
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/p2homefifi.png" alt="High-fidelity Wireframes">
          </div>
          <div class="process-image">
            <img src="images/renew.png" alt="Final UI Design">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>The final design for MenuKing delivers a clean, intuitive interface that addresses the core problems identified in research. The app includes:</p>
        
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>A fast menu scanning feature with AI-powered dish recognition</li>
          <li>Location-based food search for pre-visit planning</li>
          <li>Customizable preference settings for personalized recommendations</li>
          <li>A visually intuitive generation process with clear status indicators</li>
          <li>History tracking for favorite dishes and restaurants</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>User testing of the high-fidelity prototype showed a significant reduction in decision-making time and increased confidence in food choices among participants. The app was particularly well-received by those who identified as introverted or detail-oriented.</p>
        
        <p>For future development, I plan to implement the app using Flutter for the frontend and develop the backend with Python to create an LLM agent for web scraping and recommendation generation. This would require partnership with a developer to bring the product to market.</p>

        <p>This project taught me valuable lessons about the importance of understanding personality differences in user research and how technology can bridge communication gaps in everyday social situations. It also highlighted how seemingly simple decisions like ordering food can present significant challenges for certain user groups, creating opportunities for thoughtful design solutions.</p>
